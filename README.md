# Takl_code_challenge

The code_challenge_stacey_smith.sql file provides all the statements you'll need to run to create the queries, views, and functions required by the challenge. 

It assumes that you are running it against the same code_challenge db provided here:  https://github.com/Takl/code_challenge_database
